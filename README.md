𝐌𝐨𝐝𝐮𝐥𝐞 𝟏: 𝐂𝐥𝐨𝐧𝐞 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐂𝐨𝐝𝐞 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐒𝐞𝐭 𝐔𝐩 𝐎𝐮𝐫 𝐒𝐲𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐦
In this module, we start by cloning the repository and setting up the development environment.
We ensure that Django and Django REST Framework are installed, and we initialize the project.

𝐌𝐨𝐝𝐮𝐥𝐞 𝟐: 𝐀𝐝𝐝 𝐒𝐞𝐭𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐬 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐔𝐑𝐋 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐟𝐢𝐠𝐮𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬
This module focuses on configuring the settings for the project.
We also define the URLs that will be used for routing requests within the API.

𝐌𝐨𝐝𝐮𝐥𝐞 𝟑: 𝐂𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐅𝐢𝐫𝐬𝐭 𝐀𝐏𝐈 𝐄𝐧𝐝𝐩𝐨𝐢𝐧𝐭
Here, we implement our first API endpoint using Django REST Framework.
This endpoint will handle basic requests and demonstrate how to create views and routes.

𝐌𝐨𝐝𝐮𝐥𝐞 𝟒: 𝐖𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐞 𝐔𝐧𝐢𝐭 𝐓𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐬
This module introduces unit testing to ensure the correctness of the API.
We write tests for the API endpoint created in Module 3 to validate its functionality.

𝐌𝐨𝐝𝐮𝐥𝐞 𝟓: 𝐂𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐄𝐧𝐝𝐩𝐨𝐢𝐧𝐭𝐬 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐀𝐮𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧
In this module, we add authentication to our API endpoints.
We set up user authentication using Django's built-in authentication system or third-party solutions such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

𝐌𝐨𝐝𝐮𝐥𝐞 𝟔: 𝐂𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐈𝐭𝐞𝐦 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐎𝐫𝐝𝐞𝐫 𝐌𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐥𝐬 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐒𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐳𝐞𝐫𝐬
This module focuses on defining models for the application, such as Item and Order.
We also write serializers to convert model instances into JSON format for the API.

𝐌𝐨𝐝𝐮𝐥𝐞 𝟕: 𝐂𝐨𝐝𝐞 𝐕𝐢𝐞𝐰𝐬𝐞𝐭𝐬 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐑𝐨𝐮𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐬
In this module, we refactor the code using viewsets to handle model-based views.
We set up routers for more efficient URL routing based on viewsets.

𝐌𝐨𝐝𝐮𝐥𝐞 𝟖: 𝐖𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐞 𝐅𝐢𝐧𝐚𝐥 𝐔𝐧𝐢𝐭 𝐓𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐬
In this final module, we write unit tests to cover the endpoints created in previous modules.
We ensure full test coverage for the API, including authentication and model validation.
